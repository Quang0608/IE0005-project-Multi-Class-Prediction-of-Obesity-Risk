# IE0005-project-Multi-Class-Prediction-of-Obesity-Risk

**Description:** Obesity is a major global health concern, with its prevalence continuing to rise. Understanding the key factors that contribute to obesity risk can help in early intervention and better health management. In this project, we developed a machine learning model to classify obesity risk based on various health and lifestyle factors.
Model Selection & Evaluation: Experimented with multiple models, including Random Forest, Neural Networks, and XGBoost. 
Performance Optimization: Achieved a 92% accuracy with the optimized XGBoost model.

**Technology:** Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, XGBoost)
